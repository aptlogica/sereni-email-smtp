# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Sereni team and community take all security bugs seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at security@aptlogica.com.

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety of the report is contained within the email. Please do not add non-security related issues in the report.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Email Service Security Considerations

When reporting vulnerabilities related to email services, please include:

- SMTP configuration security issues
- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Email injection or spoofing vulnerabilities
- Template injection vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting bypass issues
- Data leakage in email headers or content

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
- Release new versions as soon as possible.
- Prominently announce the security issue in the project's changelog.
